# Distributed CWB prototype

## General design

- Focus on simple base learner:
    - Splines
    - Categorial base learner via dummy coding and ridge penalty
    - Row wise Kronecker product

## Initialization step

Since initializing base learner often requires knoledge about the pooled feature we have to consider:
- Splines: Min and max calculation for the whole feature to calculate equal knots for all sites.
- Categorical Ridge: All groups of the categorical feature to build the 0-1-design matrix.
- For both base learner: The penalty depending on the degrees of freedom needs to be calculated on the "global" $X^TX$ matrix.

After calculating these properties and sharing them with all sites, we can calculate the design matrices at each site required for modelling.
